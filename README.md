# Kinopedia

Kinopedia is an application designed for convenient organization and management of movie information, offering users a wide range of functionalities.

## Features:
Movie Search: Search for movies based on various criteria such as title, genre, release year, and more.

Cinemas: Discover which cinemas are available in your city, facilitating the planning of your cinematic outings.

Collection Management: Easily add favorite movies to your collection or remove them at any time.

Collections: Receive movie recommendations from specially curated collections to find something new and interesting to watch.

## Technologies: 
This application is developed using powerful tools such as Retrofit, Room, and Dagger Hilt, ensuring high performance and user convenience. It also adheres to the principles of Clean Architecture and the MVVM design pattern, providing a clear structure and ease of maintenance and extension. Unit and UI tests are implemented to ensure the reliability and functionality of the application across different components.

P.S. For this project, I decided not to separate the model layer, data layer, and application layer into separate modules, considering its small size and the fact that I am the sole developer.
